 Meet Qamar, she's here to help you relax and focus on living in the moment! She takes how you're feeling whenever you open the app and can present your mood ratings for the day. You can also tell her how you've been feeling and what's on your mind in the journal. You'll be able to create, edit, and delete entries. You can also read all of your entries.
Congratulations, you're at the end of module one! You've worked crazy hard to get here and have learned a ton.	**************************Meeting Qamar********************************

 After you clone this repo, run bundle install to ensure all gems/dependencies are installed onto your machine. After that, run rake db:migrate to initiate the database and the app is ready to go!
For your final project, we'll be building a Command Line database application.	**Note** You can also run rake db:seed to input dummy data into the database
